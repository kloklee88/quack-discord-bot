(All prices in 750ml)
**Bourbon (harsher but more bolder flavors):**
Jim Beam (~15) -- great value for mixing and shots, not for sipping
Jack Daniel (~25) -- wouldn't recommend sipping but it's a classic still for mixing
Buffalo Trace (~$25) -- a fantastic value whiskey that you could sip
Bulleit Bourbon (~$30) -- a solid, well-rounded whiskey
Eagle Rare 10 year (~$32) -- delicious upgrade to the above bourbons
Woodford Reserve (~$37) -- complex but affordable, one of my favorites for bourbons
Uncle Nearest 1856 (~$60) -- very smooth, pretty pricey for a bourbon but it's my #1 favorite borubon

**Scotch (peaty but smooth):**
Johnnie Walker Black (~$40) -- a classic, can't go wrong Scotch
Glenlivet 12 years: (~$60) -- my first whiskey ever, it's a great starter but on the pricey side
Macallan 12 year (~$80) -- even better than Glenlivet but the cost reflects that

**Japanese Whiskey (scotch but smoother and generally more expensive):**
Yamazaki 12 year (~$130)-- super smooth, so flavorful, rare but one of the best whiskeys ever IMO
Hibiki Harmony (~$85) -- great flavors and just as smooth, 2nd best, little less rare but amazing still
