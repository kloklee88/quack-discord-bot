xXMadreloaderXx;Hej
xXMadreloaderXx;When you’re trying to explain a complex idea to someone, it’s extremely helpful to explain your new idea using terms, concepts, or ideas that the other person already understands. \n\nFor example, if you're talking to a seasoned finance professional, you can use terms like 'EBITDA' and 'valuation multiples' and they'll understand them. \n\nHowever, if you’re speaking to someone unfamiliar with finance, you’ll want to say, 'how much money a business keeps after paying all the bills,' and 'how much someone would pay to buy the company.' You want to change your choice of words to be appropriate for your audience's level of pre-existing knowledge. This is especially the case when your audience isn’t familiar with the topic at hand.
